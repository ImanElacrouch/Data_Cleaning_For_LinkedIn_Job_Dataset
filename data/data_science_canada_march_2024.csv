EvenUp operates across a variety of personal injury cases, including motor vehicle accidents and negligence claims. Our ML-driven software empowers attorneys to accurately assess the value of these cases by doing a core part of their workflow (legal drafting), enabling them to secure larger settlements in record time. As EvenUp evaluates more cases, our proprietary data grows, enhancing the precision of our predictions and delivering more value to both attorneys and victims alike.

At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

The Role:

We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to ideation, high-level design, and then testing of medical device prototypes based on e-textiles.

To be successful, the candidate must have a strong background in interacting and collecting data with real-world patients of diverse medical conditions, a perfect mastering of the scientific method and knowledge of the clinical trial methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods), and experience in the redaction of scientific reports and papers.

Experience with bio-signals and/or low-power wearable systems would be an important asset. Applicants should have a keen eye for solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and be able to rapidly design/prototype these ideas.

The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, textile experts, fashion designers and entrepreneurs to actively participate in the creation and optimization of new products and should be able to effectively work in multi-disciplinary teams.

Responsibilities:


 * Research, design, and test for the development of the next generation of smart textiles.
 * Rapid ideation, implementation, and validation of biosignal measuring methods and/or devices.
 * Work closely with a variety of people/teams with different disciplines (mechanical, firmware, data science, software, industrial design, textile, quality assurance, regulatory) and mutually educate each other to allow effective teamwork.
 * Aid in the testing of prototypes and debug issues on the fly.
 * Conducting research and designing protocols to study the attitude towards Myant product and any resulting behavior change.

Shopify is innovating faster than any other commerce stack. We put independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We transform enteprises and work with some of the world's biggest names and brands who are pushing the limits — and expect us to, too.

While millions of merchants in over 175 countries already use Shopify, the remaining opportunity is vat. This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.

About The Role

About the role

As a Product Analytics professional, you'll be tasked with transforming raw data into actionable insights that will help guide the development and improvement of our products. This role isn't for the faint-hearted or those seeking a conventional corporate structure - we operate on the principles of low process, high trust, and high impact. It's all about getting things done quickly and efficiently, while continuously learning and adapting to changes in a dynamic environment.

Our product is designed to empower entrepreneurs. Consequently, the work you do will not only create value for our users but also contribute to global entrepreneurship. To thrive here, you need to be dedicated to your craft and committed to constant development. You should be an independent thinker who can solve complex problems and handle a bit of chaos without breaking a sweat.

As a Senior Data Scientist, you will partner with Product, Engineering, UX, and other disciplines to lead through data and achieve product/business goals. Product Data Scientists are expected to:


 * Proactively identify and champion projects that solve complex problems in important business areas.
 * Partner closely with product, engineering and other business leaders to influence product and program decisions with data
 * Holistically own general problems in those product/business domains and understand how those problems/domains interact with the rest of Shopify.
 * Build actionable KPIs, production-quality dashboards, informative deep dives, and scalable data products
 * Apply specialized skills and fundamental data science methods (e.g. regression, survival analysis, segmentation, experimentation, and machine learning when appropriate) to inform improvements to our business
 * Design and implement end-to-end data pipelines: work closely with stakeholders, especially data engineering, to build instrumentation and define dimensional models, tables or schemas that support business processes
 * Influence leadership to drive more data-informed decisions
 * Define and advance best practices within your data science and product teams
   
   
   

There are several teams looking for Product Data Scientists to partner with and help drive value for our merchants. These include:

Core Ecosystem, International, and Marketing

Merchants use Shopify in a variety of ways, using a wide array of first-party features and augmenting them with third-party apps. These all come together to help merchant’s meet their diverse needs. A shoe brand in Canada, a small jeweler in Japan, and a Fortune 500 company in Germany all need different tools so succeed! This Data Science team is focused on helping merchants make the most use of these different features and apps all over the world.

Checkout & Storefront

The Core Product Data Science team combines leading-edge analytical techniques with strong business & product acumen in order to drive better decisions and outcomes for Shopify’s merchants. Data Scientists turn data into actionable insights through a number of analytical methods, such as A/B tests, In-depth studies, advanced modeling, data visualizations, etc. to shape and support our product development strategies.

Executive Insights

The Executive Insights team supports Shopify leadership in setting the direction of the company, sharing our message of entrepreneurship to the world, and investing in building the best products for our merchants. We do this by combining a deep understanding of the entrepreneurs that use our products, our position in the marketplace and the challenges our merchants face.

Qualifications


 * Extensive experience in product analytics, experimentation, metrics research, and working with engineers on instrumentation and robust data pipelining
 * Extensive experience in a data science role solving large-scale, high impact business problems
 * Masterful data storytelling and strategic thinking, with an ability to inspire and cultivate the Data culture within your team
 * Extensive experience using Python including a strong grasp of object oriented programming (OOP) fundamentals
 * Deep understanding of advanced SQL techniques and data modeling
 * Well versed with various Business Intelligence platforms and tools
 * Experience working with various levels of business stakeholders, from c-suite to engineering and product development teams.
 * Working on multiple work streams excites you, and you are able to use ambiguity as an opportunity for high-level thinking
 * Experience creating data product strategies, building data products, and continued iteration after launch
 * Experience launching productionized machine learning models at scale is a plus
 * Extensive domain experience in e-commerce, sales & marketing or SaaS is a plus

Abnormal Security is looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join the Message Detection - Attack Detection team. At Abnormal, we protect our customers against nefarious adversaries who are constantly evolving their techniques and tactics to outwit and undermine the traditional approaches to Security. That’s what makes our novel behavioral-based approach so…Abnormal. Abnormal has constantly been named as one of the top cybersecurity startups and our behavioral AI system has helped us win various cybersecurity accolades resulting in being trusted to protect more than 8% of the Fortune 1000 ( and ever growing ).

In a landscape where a single successful attack can lead to financial losses of millions of dollars, the Attack Detection team plays the central role of building an extremely high recall Detection Engine that can operate on hundreds of millions of messages at milliseconds latency. The Attack Detection team’s mission statement is to provide world-class detector efficacy to tackle changing attack landscape using a combination of generalizable and auto trained models as well as specific detectors for high value attack categories.

This team is solving a multi-layered detection problem, which involves modeling communication patterns to establish enterprise-wide baselines, incorporating these patterns as robust signals, and combining these signals with contextual information to create extremely precise systems. The team builds discriminative signals at various levels including message level (eg. presence of particular phrases), sender-level (eg.frequency of sender) and recipient level (eg.likelihood of receiving a safe message). These signals are then combined and utilized to train highly accurate model based as well as heuristic detectors. Additionally, to continuously adapt to new unseen attacks, the team builds out different stages in our automated model retraining pipelines including data analytics and generation stages, modeling stages, production evaluation stages as well as automated deployment stages.

This role would also have an opportunity to have a significant impact on the overall charter, direction and roadmap of the team. The Machine Learning Engineer would be involved in understanding the domain of false negatives i.e. the current and future attacks which can cause significant customer workflow disruption. They would help define the technical roadmap required to address the most pressing customer problems and simultaneously operate our detection decisioning system at an extremely high recall.

We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.

Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there’s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.

We’re looking for a Data Science Lead to grow the impact of our small DS function at Kojo. This highly impactful role will support our analytics and inference needs as we continue to grow and invest in the future of our product.

About The Role

In this role, you will be hands-on providing reliable insights to the business about our customers and product, and will help make key decisions about the evolution of our analytics stack and organizational data maturity.

Initially, you will have one data scientist reporting to you focusing on the machine learning and product intelligence track, and you help them grow, and identify and leverage synergies between the two areas.

This role will include:


 * Updating and evolving our critical business metrics with C-level and Board of Directors visibility
 * In collaboration with engineers, ensuring a reliable and clean data flow into the data warehouse and developing key business insights with that data
 * Building on our established models, or developing your own strategies, to ensure our real-world data consistently meets the standards for meaningful business insights
 * Providing uniquely valuable insights to our customers with dashboard, reports, and recommendations
 * Providing metrics feedback to the product and engineering org to maximize customer value out of the features we ship
 * Enabling the finance, sales, CS, and other departments with the foundation to consistently make data driven decisions
 * Leading a second data scientist in our machine learning function to build innovative data-driven product features such as Kojo’s universal catalog, as well as recommended product and vendor selection.
   
   

About You

The ideal person in this role is an experienced full-stack data scientist who will own, and thoughtfully grow, our small but mighty data science function!

What you’ve accomplished:


 * 4+ years of experience in an analytics-focused data role, previous experience establishing or leading a data science function strongly preferred
 * Experience with our tech stack:
    * Python, SQL, and BI Tooling required; + Azure, AWS, GCP, and Docker preferred

 * Track record of executing quickly and iterating effectively on projects
 * Empathy when working with internal cross-functional stakeholders and on client-facing work
 * A history of raising the quality of real-world business and usage data to the level required to produce reliable insights.
 * Keen ability to translate nontechnical requests into precise and reliable terms
 * An understanding of complex disparate data sources and how to unify them
   
   

What you care about:


 * Customer Obsession: You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them
 * Innovation: You look for the truth behind problems and for “10x” solutions
 * Growth: You are excited by problems because they’re opportunities for improvement
   
   

The salary range for this role is between $175,000 and $210,000 for candidates located in the US. We are also open to candidates based in Canada, with a compensation range commensurate with experience and location. The role is remote with no travel required.

About the team

Today, data scientists piece together data, tooling, and frameworks to get bespoke data science workloads running and producing business value. Data scientists then hand off models to engineering teams to attempt to deploy them to production. These teams speak different languages, use different tools, and have completely different workflows. This makes it very difficult to deploy data science workloads to production, increasing time to value and costs. One of our primary goals for our ModelOps stage is to reduce the complexities of data science workloads and integrate these workloads to easily be managed and developed within GitLab.

Parallelz enables developers and their existing mobile apps/games, without any SDKs, code changes, or engineering efforts to instantly improve user acquisition, organic virality, new revenue channels, and user experiences and capabilities that were not possible before.

With Parallelz, users can access mobile apps instantly, with lossless quality, at full performance, on any desktop or mobile device. The Parallelz platform enables this by transforming existing native mobile apps into fully-native web apps, in real-time, that can be instantly accessible on any browser. Developers can now have a new frictionless way to reach their customers, free from the restrictions and taxations of the existing app stores.

Parallelz unlocks millions of existing native mobile apps from their silos and transforms them into a more powerful and valuable asset that is fully web-native.

Furthermore, this enables entirely new types of dynamically personalized, user and ML-generated, synthetic app experiences.

Our company is building a new technology platform that enables new ways of delivering, discovering, and extending mobile applications -- ways that were never thought possible.

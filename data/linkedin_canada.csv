Over 200 applicants,18586257.0,Abnormal Security,Full-time,"About The Role

Abnormal Security is looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join the Message Detection - Attack Detection team. At Abnormal, we protect our customers against nefarious adversaries who are constantly evolving their techniques and tactics to outwit and undermine the traditional approaches to Security. That’s what makes our novel behavioral-based approach so…Abnormal. Abnormal has constantly been named as one of the top cybersecurity startups and our behavioral AI system has helped us win various cybersecurity accolades resulting in being trusted to protect more than 8% of the Fortune 1000 ( and ever growing ).

In a landscape where a single successful attack can lead to financial losses of millions of dollars, the Attack Detection team plays the central role of building an extremely high recall Detection Engine that can operate on hundreds of millions of messages at milliseconds latency. The Attack Detection team’s mission statement is to provide world-class detector efficacy to tackle changing attack landscape using a combination of generalizable and auto trained models as well as specific detectors for high value attack categories.

This team is solving a multi-layered detection problem, which involves modeling communication patterns to establish enterprise-wide baselines, incorporating these patterns as robust signals, and combining these signals with contextual information to create extremely precise systems. The team builds discriminative signals at various levels including message level (eg. presence of particular phrases), sender-level (eg.frequency of sender) and recipient level (eg.likelihood of receiving a safe message). These signals are then combined and utilized to train highly accurate model based as well as heuristic detectors. Additionally, to continuously adapt to new unseen attacks, the team builds out different stages in our automated model retraining pipelines including data analytics and generation stages, modeling stages, production evaluation stages as well as automated deployment stages.

This role would also have an opportunity to have a significant impact on the overall charter, direction and roadmap of the team. The Machine Learning Engineer would be involved in understanding the domain of false negatives i.e. the current and future attacks which can cause significant customer workflow disruption. They would help define the technical roadmap required to address the most pressing customer problems and simultaneously operate our detection decisioning system at an extremely high recall.

What you will do


 * Design and implement systems that combine rules, models, feature engineering, and business and product inputs into an email detection product, with senior engineer guidance.
 * Understand features that distinguish safe emails from email attacks, and how our model stack enables us to catch them.
 * Identify and recommend new features groups or ML model approaches that can significantly improve detection efficacy for a product. Work with infrastructure & systems engineers to productionize signals to feed into the detection system.
 * Writes code with testability, readability, edge cases, and errors in mind.
 * Train models on well-defined datasets to improve model efficacy on specialized attacks
 * Actively monitor and improve FN rates and efficacy rates for our message detection product attack categories, through feature engineering, rules and ML modeling.
 * Analyze FN and FP datasets to categorize capability gaps and recommend short term feature and rule ideas to improve our detection efficacy.
 * Contribute in other areas of the stack: building and debugging data pipelines, or presenting results back to customers in our tools when the occasion arises
   
   

Must Haves


 * 3+ years experience designing, building and deploying machine learning applications in one of the domains of text understanding, entity recognition, NLP experience, computer vision, recommendation systems, or search.
 * 1+ years of experience with writing stable and production level pipelines for model training and evaluation leading to reproducible models and metrics.
 * Experience with data analytics and wielding SQL+pandas+spark framework to both build data and metric generation pipelines, and answer critical questions about system efficacy or counterfactual treatments.
 * Ability to understand business requirements thoroughly and bias toward designing a simplest yet generalizable ML model / system that can accomplish the goal.
 * Uses a systematic approach to debug both data and system issues within ML / heuristics models.
 * Fluent with Python and machine learning toolkits like numpy, sklearn, pytorch and tensorflow.
 * Effective software engineering skills who can find answers quickly from code base and writes structured, readable, well tested and efficient code.

Requirements



As a Senior Data Scientist at Float:

 * You'll develop a data strategy that is aligned to Float's strategy, identify key metrics, which data needs to be collected, and set the processes for how data will be stored, cleaned, and maintained at Float
 * You'll build upon Float's data infrastructure and determine which technologies and tools the company should use for its data science activities.

Mappedin, headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, is a global leader in indoor mapping and spatial data management. Our solutions power billions of square feet of indoor space and millions of people visiting malls, stadiums, offices, retail establishments, healthcare facilities, warehouses, colleges and universities to name a few. Mappedin's cutting-edge technology optimizes indoor spaces, enhances user experiences, and strengthens public safety through user-friendly digital mapping.

Guided by the ethos ""One Map Everywhere,"" we envision indoor maps as commonplace as their outdoor counterparts. Mappedin is committed to creating accessible and user-friendly products, leveraging our extensive experience and Machine Learning for automated paper-to-digital floor plan conversion.

Who You Are And What You’ll Do

You’re a developer that wants to build great web applications with React used by millions of people and aren’t put off by the opportunity to write Node.js backend code from time to time. What you really care about is clean code that works, covered with high quality automated tests.

Your team is responsible for both maintaining Mappedin’s current Indoor Mapping Software as well as building our next generation Editor product. That means you should already have or are interested in obtaining experience in:


 * Front End Application Development using React
 * TypeScript
 * Test Driven Development
 * Map rendering frameworks such as deck.gl, Leaflet, or MapBox GL JS
   
   

What are some challenges?

Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.

Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.

There is a lot of discovery work involved as we frequently do things that are ahead of current technology. We also encounter tough problems that require a lot of math. It’s not a requirement for this role, but if you enjoy solving interesting geometry problems, we’d love to have your input.

Behind the scenes

We run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.

We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.

There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We are a REMOTE company. If you’re local, there will probably be a few days a week when you can expect other people to be in the office, but this role could also be fully remote. We work flexible hours, have a flexible vacation policy and work to provide the hardware or office equipment you require to unleash your potential. We will do what it takes to get things done if we said we would do it. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together. We want you to join us.

We expect interns to become valuable contributors to the team, as they work hand-in-hand with people ranging from engineering to design to business development.

We also realize that mentorship is important to allow interns to grow and develop skills in areas which they're looking to improve. For example, every intern will have a full-time engineer as a mentor, and weekly 1:1s with their managers to get feedback and ensure things are going well. We also emphasize code reviews and hold weekly engineering tech talks to maintain high code quality and to optimize for learning the best engineering practices.

This internship will run for 16 weeks beginning in April.

Over 200 applicants,18586257.0,Abnormal Security,Full-time,"About The Role

Abnormal Security is looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to join the Message Detection Decisioning team. At Abnormal, we protect our customers against nefarious adversaries who are constantly evolving their techniques and tactics to outwit and undermine the traditional approaches to Security. That’s what makes our novel behavioral-based approach so…Abnormal. Abnormal has constantly been named as one of the top cybersecurity startups and our behavioral AI system has helped us win various cybersecurity accolades resulting in being trusted to protect more than 8% of the Fortune 1000 ( and ever growing ).

In a landscape where a single successful attack can lead to financial losses of millions of dollars, the Message Detection Decisioning team plays the central role of building an extremely precise Detection Engine that can operate on hundreds of millions of messages at milliseconds latency. Every email ingested by Abnormal flows through the workflow owned by the Detection Decisioning team which applies hundreds of signals and detectors on a message based on the message and user context. The system then computes the final overall decision for the system and consequently chronicles attribution to drive various offline and online metrics such as offline precision, online precision, online False Negative Rate etc.

This team is solving a multi-layered detection problem, which involves modeling communication patterns to establish enterprise-wide baselines, incorporating these patterns as robust signals, and combining these signals with contextual information to create extremely high precision systems. The team builds discriminative signals at various levels including message level (eg. presence of particular phrases), sender-level (eg.frequency of sender) and recipient level (eg.likelihood of receiving a safe message) which forms the foundation to create highly accurate heuristic and model based detectors. Additionally to maintain an overall high precise detection system, the team innovates on software systems and processes which can be quickly adapted to solve trends seen in the short term as well as generalize well in the longer term.

This role would also have an opportunity to have a huge impact on the overall charter, direction and growth of the team. The Senior Machine Learning Engineer would be involved in understanding the most pressing customer problems in the domain of false positives and build out the associated technical roadmap to continuously operate our detection decisioning system at an extremely high precision.

What you will do


 * Design and implement systems that combine rules, models, feature engineering, and business and product inputs into an email detection product.
 * Identify and recommend new features groups or ML model approaches that can significantly improve detection efficacy for a product. Work with infrastructure & systems engineers to productionize signals to feed into the detection system.
 * Understand features that distinguish safe emails from email attacks, and how our detector stack enables us to catch them.
 * Be the expert in main detection pipelines and decision data flow to be able to drive debugging in systematic degradations caused by bad detectors.
 * Writes code with testability, readability, edge cases, and errors in mind.
 * Train models on well-defined datasets to improve model efficacy on specialized attacks
 * Actively monitor and improve False Positive rates and efficacy rates for our message detection product attack categories, through feature engineering, rules and ML modeling.
 * Analyze False Negative and False Posi datasets to categorize capability gaps and recommend short term feature and rule ideas to improve our detection efficacy.
 * Contribute in other areas of the stack: building and debugging data pipelines, or presenting results back to customers in our tools when the occasion arises
 * Lead the team’s medium and long term roadmap and drive planning and execution strategy for the pod.
 * Coach and mentor junior engineers to uplevel their code quality and ML effectiveness by providing quality code reviews and design reviews.
 * Participate in building a world-class detection engine across all layers - data quality, feature engineering, model development, experimentation and operation.
   
   

Must Haves

 * Fluent with Python and machine learning libraries like numpy and scikit-learn.
 * Experience with data analytics and wielding SQL+pandas+spark framework to both build data and metric generation pipelines, and answer critical questions about system efficacy or counterfactual treatments.
 * Independently responsible for the entire lifecycle of projects or features including eng design, development, and deployment.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Transaction Risk organization optimizes each of the billions of dollars of transactions processed by Stripe annually on behalf of our users, maximizing successful transactions while minimizing payment costs and fraud. We own products like Radar end-to-end, developing machine learning models, building fast and scalable services and creating intuitive user experiences.

We are proud of the company we’ve built so far, but we are even more excited for what is yet to come. Our 5000+ customers include global leaders, startups that are disrupting industries, and businesses around the world. Lever has raised $123 million in funding, most recently a $50M Series D in November 2021.

With an overall gender ratio of 50:50 women and men, Lever is also fiercely committed to building a team culture that celebrates diversity and inclusion. We have been certified as a “Great Place to Work”, along with “Best Company Outlook 2022,” and “Forbes Best Startup Employers 2022,” and the list keeps growing! Our people are Lever’s biggest competitive advantage. For more information on our team culture, visit https://inside.lever.co/.

THE OPPORTUNITY

As an Engineer on our Product team, you’ll help us build out our core product by developing high-impact, user-facing features. In our growing engineering organization, you’ll be developing and shipping new features and updates to Lever’s product. You’ll be learning about our real-time web stack UI frameworks that help us deliver a beautiful and high quality solution to our customers. In addition, working on API's and integrations to support our partners. You’ll work collaboratively with product managers and designers to drive the implementation and release of major features, and be a champion of best practices for writing well-tested, well-organized code.

You’ll become familiar with all parts of our stack—including our open source web framework, DerbyJS. You will exercise judgment in making tradeoffs between design and feasibility. You’ll engineer extension points to be scalable and resilient in a complex, single-page application.

We believe that user-centric design ultimately leads to the best products, so we listen closely to our users, both external and internal.

Read About What Our Team Values And Why Here.

THE TECH STACK

Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, TypeScript, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Over 200 applicants,1196866.0,Wave HQ,Full-time,"We believe small businesses are at the heart of our communities, and championing them is worth fighting for. We empower small business owners to manage their finances fearlessly, by offering the simplest, all-in-one financial management solution they can't live without.




About the Engineering Team:




We aim to meaningfully improve the lives of small business owners, who are traditionally under-served and often struggle because of this. At Wave, you won’t just write code—you’ll build high-quality systems at scale. This means being involved in the research, design, and organizational and maintenance practices behind our wide range of applications, which are relied upon by tens of thousands of small business owners. You won’t find many hardcore specialists here. Most Wave engineers are willing and able to dive into different technologies to get the job done. This requires curiosity, openness to new ideas and perspectives, and a genuine interest in what makes software products tick.




About The Role:




As a Software Engineer on the Payroll team, you will join a critical team supporting a key SaaS product in the Wave suite. Leveraging your background in Ruby on Rails and (ideally) your knowledge of Payroll systems, you will work with some fantastic engineers to solve tough problems in delivering world-class financial products to our customers at scale. You will be exposed to a wide variety of technologies and help investigate new ones as we are constantly striving to keep our technology choices up to date. As an engineering team, we deeply care about being the best in our craft - Performance, Reliability, Reusability, Code Quality, Test Coverage, and Observability. You will help maintain the current bar we have but will hopefully go on to raise it to the next level.




Here’s What You Should Know About Engineering at Wave:




 * Our Technology: Wave is powered by several key technologies. The Payroll team is looking for engineers with full-stack development experience using Ruby on Rails. We want teammates who are borderline obsessive about testing and quality of workmanship. Experience with web application and distributed system development is a must. Background in Payroll or Financial systems would be an asset. Our APIs are GraphQL and REST powered by services written in Python and Django, as well as Rails. We expect software developers to have enough familiarity with API development to be able to collaborate with back-end developers to devise solutions to product challenges, and to contribute to code on the API layer when needed
 * Your Work Will Matter: Every engineer at Wave is tasked with solving meaty, meaningful challenges for a really important end-user - our small business owners. The code you write will make a difference, guaranteed
 * We Are a Community: Wave is about the size of a small neighbourhood. It is possible to get to know everyone on a personal basis. If you’re trying to solve a hard problem that has roots in some other part of the company, odds are pretty good that you’ll find someone close by who can help you out
 * You Will be Stretched: We’re big on transparency and we know Wave isn’t for everyone. However, if you’re ready to flex your creativity, excel at your craft, fuel your curiosity, and thrive in a dynamic environment, we’re confident you’ll love being a Waver
   
   

At Wave, you’re treated like the incredible human being you are.




Work From Where You Work Best: We will always have a welcoming, energizing, and world-class office (in Toronto) with a space for you. Or, if you’re more comfortable working from home, the choice is yours.




We Care About Future You: You will stretch yourself and you will grow at Wave. You will also be supported on this journey with diverse learning experiences, educational allowances, mentorship, and so much more.




We Support the Full You: We make a serious investment in your health & wellness. When we think about benefits we think about body, mind, & soul and we take this stuff very seriously.




We Take Care of the Fundamentals: Fair compensation, all the office perks you’d want, and the various goodies you’d expect from a growing tech company. This is the obvious stuff, but we don’t want you to think we forgot!




We believe that a diverse and inclusive culture creates the best workplace. We embrace our differences, value individuality, and the broad spectrum of every Waver's skills and abilities. We challenge each other from a place of respect and pursuit of continuous growth. We trust each other and encourage everyone to bring their authentic selves to work, everyday. As Wavers, our voices matter, our opinions are met with an open mind. The best ideas win, no matter whose they are. Contributing to an inclusive culture is a part of all of our job descriptions.




We’ve been continuously recognized as one of Canada's Top Ten Most Admired Corporate Cultures and one of Canada’s Great Places to Work in categories including Technology, Millennials, Mental Health, Inclusion and Women.

Over 200 applicants,68940167.0,Peggy,Full-time,"Senior Mobile Developer - Flutter/Dart

About Peggy

Peggy is the secure marketplace for investment-grade art. The company was founded by serial entrepreneurs Craig Follett and Adam Meghji, who have worked together for over a decade, and sold their last business to Live Nation Entertainment.

In times of societal crisis and turmoil throughout humanity, artists pave the way for social change and transformation. As an investment, art is among the only appreciating asset classes you can also enjoy (like real estate), plus is uncorrelated to traditional markets. This is why billionaires and banks seek out art as a safe haven to preserve wealth in their portfolios. Yet tragically, the rest of us are unable to participate in the art market, and support the practice of emerging artists who create transformative messages through their works.

Peggy partners with galleries and artists, to make living with and investing in art accessible to all. Finally you can buy incredible art at a price you can afford, and can later sell to fellow collectors if your tastes change or you seek to rebalance your art investments. Core to our values, Peggy does good by the artists themselves, who can finally earn artist royalties for all future secondary sales as well - something they miss out on today. This is all made possible using sophisticated and proprietary AI and ML which keeps buyers and sellers protected without the need for the antiquated and opaque Auction House model.

About The Role

Peggy is looking for a talented Flutter developer to work on our mobile-first frontend app. You will be partnering with our design, backend, and technical leadership teams as we drive towards our exciting alpha release.

Our world-class design team extensively uses Figma to create hi-fi mobile interfaces. You are responsible for providing initial developer feedback to them directly and iterating in Figma, before building the interfaces in Flutter. The backend team will provide you with an elegant and well-documented GraphQL API as an entry-point into Peggy's content, data, and business logic, and can incorporate your feedback as the API's first consumer.

Peggy's CTO, who will be involved in reviewing, testing, and providing feedback on your work. As a leader who believes in mentorship, guidance, and coaching, Peggy's CTO will also be involved in helping you hit the company goals you can directly impact, as well as encouraging your continued growth and happiness at all stages of your career.

Mosey makes employment compliance a breeze so fast-growing companies can hire and operate anywhere—without the administrative burden.

What's so hard about hiring people in multiple locations anyway?

Each country, state, and municipality has its own employment requirements that need to be maintained on an ongoing basis. Those requirements span HR, tax, accounting, and legal which is complicated and requires deep expertise. As a result, keeping up with the differences and the sheer volume of obligations makes hiring people in many locations expensive and painful.

You will


 * Build tools and automation that helps users manage employment compliance
 * Building UI/UX that help users solve their compliance problems
 * Design, implement and iterate new features from scratch
 * Help synthesize user feedback and use it to inform future development
 * Lay the groundwork for future engineering and product development
 * Set up initial infrastructure and continuous integration workflows
 * Work closely with the founder and founding team to build prototypes and MVPs
   
   

We're looking for someone with


 * 5+ years of hands-on experience as a software engineer
 * Strong collaboration skills and excellent communication (written and verbal)
 * A combination of technical ability and a deep understanding of what makes a great product
 * Ability to solve novel problems and think critically about the best solutions
   
   

You would be a good fit if


 * You want your work to have a positive impact and create economic opportunity
 * You have experience working at a startup or led a new project from scratch
 * You have experience with TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and/or Vue
 * You are excited about the opportunity to learn new things and go beyond engineering
 * You embody urgency and focus, but also have an exacting standard of quality
 * You like to build systems and processes from the ground up
   
   

Our operating principles:

Pursue knowledge

Lead with curiosity, reject bad explanations, and create objective knowledge with a tradition of conjecture and criticism.

Writing is thinking

Many seemingly good ideas don’t survive closer inspection when written down. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try, it’s precisely why you should.

Exude warmth

Build a working environment that is welcoming and supportive. Others will want to gather around you.

Be ambitious

We can do more than we think with imagination and resolve. Solving important problems requires it.

Our benefits:


 * Competitive compensation with material equity ownership
 * Health insurance including medical, dental, and vision
 * Mosey pays 100% of your employee premium
 * 3 weeks vacation
 * 8 Paid Company Holidays
 * Paid Family Leave
 * Opportunity to join a diverse, passionate, and fun team at a pivotal time in the company’s lifecycle
 * Remote first (continental US)

Shopify is innovating faster than any other commerce stack. We put independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We transform enteprises and work with some of the world's biggest names and brands who are pushing the limits — and expect us to, too.

While millions of merchants in over 175 countries already use Shopify, the remaining opportunity is vat. This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.

About The Role

About the role

As a Product Analytics professional, you'll be tasked with transforming raw data into actionable insights that will help guide the development and improvement of our products. This role isn't for the faint-hearted or those seeking a conventional corporate structure - we operate on the principles of low process, high trust, and high impact. It's all about getting things done quickly and efficiently, while continuously learning and adapting to changes in a dynamic environment.

Our product is designed to empower entrepreneurs and stimulate personal growth. Consequently, the work you do will not only create value for our users but also contribute to global entrepreneurship. To thrive here, you need to be dedicated to your craft and committed to constant development. You should be an independent thinker who can solve complex problems and handle a bit of chaos without breaking a sweat.

As a Staff Data Scientist, you will partner with Product, Engineering, UX, and other disciplines to lead through data and achieve product/business goals. Product Data Scientists are expected to:


 * Proactively identify and champion projects that solve complex problems across multiple domains and business areas.
 * Partner closely with product, engineering and other business leaders to influence high level strategy, product development, and program decisions with data
 * Holistically own general problems across product/business domains and drive the right outcomes for all of Shopify.
 * Build actionable KPIs, production-quality dashboards, informative deep dives, and scalable data products that are effective for their purpose and model excellence for the entire organization.
 * Apply specialized skills and fundamental data science methods (e.g. regression, survival analysis, segmentation, experimentation, and machine learning when appropriate) to directly drive substantial improvements to our business
 * Design and implement end-to-end data pipelines: work closely with stakeholders, especially data engineering, to build instrumentation and define dimensional models, tables or schemas that support business processes.
 * Influence leadership to drive more data-informed decisions and to nurture a culture of using data effectively company-wide.
 * Define and advance best practices within data science and product teams across Shopify.

Checkout & Storefront

The Core Product Data Science team combines leading-edge analytical techniques with strong business & product acumen in order to drive better decisions and outcomes for Shopify’s merchants. Data Scientists turn data into actionable insights through a number of analytical methods, such as A/B tests, In-depth studies, advanced modeling, data visualizations, etc. to shape and support our product development strategies.

Commercial/Revenue Analytics

The Commercial/Revenue Analytics team provides data insights to help our revenue leadership team with understanding business performance through data, support key business decisions, and advise on business operational improvement opportunities. As a Staff Product Data Scientist, you’ll help advance the data maturity of the team to move from descriptive analytics into predictive/prescriptive analytics so we can leverage data to strengthen performance and effectiveness across pre-sales, to sales, and post-sales.

Support Data Science

The Support Data Science team builds data products to continuously enable the monitoring and improvement of Shopify’s customer service, knowledge management, merchant satisfaction and retention using cutting edge analytical and AI-powered methodologies such as causal inference, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, etc. Additionally, this team is responsible for synthesizing the voice of customers (Shopify merchants) from all merchant interactions and providing critical feedback for Shopify’s product improvements.

Honeycomb is built to help engineering teams deeply explore and understand their own production systems — in real time. It’s a service for the near and present future, where distributed systems are the new default, every service is a platform, and empowered generalist software engineers are the new ops. We are passionate about consumer-quality developer tools and excited to build technology that raises our industry’s expectations of what our tools can do for us. We’re working with well known companies like HelloFresh, Slack, LaunchDarkly, and Vanguard and more across a range of industries. This is an exciting time in our trajectory, as we’ve closed Series D funding, scaled past the 150-person mark, and were named to Forbes’ America’s Best Startups of 2022!

As a Product Engineer on this team, you’ll be joining a growing product engineering team, helping us to build a range of features pivotal to the Honeycomb experience, like core concepts used to organize data, as well as features like derived columns, SLOs and Triggers. Check out this recent blog post about Budget Rate Alerts to see more about what this team has been up to!

Who We Are

We come for the impact, and stay for the culture! We’re a talented, opinionated, passionate, fiercely inclusive, and responsible group of bees. We have conviction and we strive to live our values every day. We want our people to do what they truly love amongst a team of highly talented (but humble) peers.

How We Work

We are a remote-first company, which means we believe it is not where you sit, but how you deliver that matters most. We invest in our people and care about how you orient to our culture and processes. At the same time we imbue a lot of trust, autonomy, and accountability from Day 1.

We can hire for this role in the United States and Canada.

What You’ll Do:


 * Build and deliver quality software. You will write code across the full application stack, primarily in Typescript/React and Go. While most of your time will be focused on delivering software, you will be trusted to model best practices, work on team-level projects, and weigh in on larger technical decisions with the team
 * Collaborate with cross-functional partners. Our team follows a product triad model composed of design, product, and engineering. You will collaborate with these partners, beginning with problem discovery through solution design and delivery. We work through building small changes/experiments and then iterate based on customer interaction
 * Support our software/systems in production. We believe in owning the software that we build. The ownership is built through defining our own team KPIs, product SLOs, and alerting. Every engineer on the team participates in an on-call rotation to support issues that our customers encounter (reactive) and to look for other areas of toil that our customers may face (proactive)
 * Learn new ways to solve complex problems. As our company and product grow, we regularly face new challenges in scaling to meet our customers’ demands. You will learn new technologies as we look for new ways to use our databases, caches, and streams to optimize for this growth. With the support of your team and the larger organization you can be creative in your problem solving, experiment carefully, and participate in designing novel solutions
   
   
   

What You’ll Bring:


 * Experience working across an application stack. You have experience with modern frontend and backend languages. You have delivered features for which you built the UI, as well as the database migrations, services, and API endpoints that power them. You also bring experience with services that interact with distributed data stores, like event streaming (Kafka).
 * Comfortable supporting production software. You have experience shipping features to production and understand how to investigate and triage issues in your deployed code. You may have participated in an on-call rotation before and have opinions about making it an effective and positive experience (read about how we track on-call health)
 * A strong sense of teamwork. By working as a member of an effective team our shared objectives are consistently reached, our users benefit from our rapid delivery, we grow together by sharing knowledge, and we ensure that every team member can get the rest and time away they need
 * A flexible mindset. The urgency of product delivery within a growing business sometimes requires us to alter our strategies or roadmap. You have an open mind and are comfortable pivoting when necessary to meet the company's or customers' needs
 * Can balance engineering investment with customer value. It’s easy to get caught up in building a perfectly polished solution and lose the context of the value you are delivering. You have experience revisiting scope and working in small iterations to quickly put features in customers’ hands
   
   
   

What You Get When You Join The Hive!


 * Base pay (range) of $162,000 - $186,000 USD
